## Draft Statement of Interest

I am Yuheng Qiu, a fifth-year PhD student in Mechanical Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, advised by Sebastian Scherer. I expect to graduate in 2026 and am actively entering the academic and industry research job market. My research focuses on learned uncertainty for generalizable vision-inertial spatial perception, with the goal of enabling SLAM and odometry systems that work for any robot, anywhere, without manual tuning.

I completed my undergraduate degree in Computer Science and Engineering at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, before joining CMU's AirLab in 2019 as a research associate and subsequently starting my PhD in 2021. My work has been recognized with the ICRA 2025 Best Conference Paper Award and Best Paper Award on Robot Perception for MAC-VO, a learning-based stereo visual odometry system that predicts metrics-aware covariance. I have interned at Amazon FAR lab, Skild AI, and OPPO, and have given invited talks at institutions including UPenn GRASP, NASA JPL, Google AR, and the University of Zurich.

I want to participate in the RSS Pioneers workshop because it offers a unique opportunity to connect with the robotics community at a pivotal moment in my career. As I transition from PhD to faculty or industry research roles, I seek mentorship from established researchers, feedback on my research vision, and visibility among peers and potential collaborators. The Pioneers program is designed precisely for early-career researchers at this stage, and I hope to learn from both the formal program and informal conversations about navigating the job market, building a research group, and sustaining a long-term research agenda in spatial AI and robot perception.

I also hope to contribute to the workshop by sharing my perspective on learned uncertainty as a unifying principle for robust perception. My work spans visual odometry, inertial odometry, quantization for edge deployment, and tuning-free visual-inertial fusion. I believe the RSS community, with its emphasis on rigorous robotics research, is the ideal forum to discuss how learning-based methods can be grounded in classical estimation theory and deployed reliably on real robots.

The Pioneers program is important to me because it bridges the gap between being a student and becoming an independent researcher. I am eager to receive guidance on positioning my research, communicating my vision to hiring committees, and building the relationships that will shape my future collaborations. I look forward to engaging with the program committee and fellow pioneers.

## Character Count

**Current:** ~3025 characters (under 3500 limit).

## Optional Additions

The instructions ask for **institutional and personal background** (e.g., first-generation student, regionally underrepresented university). If any of these apply to you, consider adding 1–2 sentences. Examples:
